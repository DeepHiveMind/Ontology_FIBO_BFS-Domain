Please note, Reference Entities cannot be senior or subordinated. It is the obligations of the Reference Entities that can be senior or subordinated. ISDA 2003 Term: Reference Entity' Although the CDS is made out with reference to some security (issued by some party) or some loan to some party, the underlying purpose of the CDS is to protect that instrument in the event of some Credit Event that is to do with the issuing (debtor) party itself. Credit Events are therefore defined in relation to the Legal Entity and not in relation to the Security itself.

    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">FpML adds "Furthermore the Reference Obligation is ALWAYS deliverable and establishes the Pari Passu ranking (as the deliverable bonds must rank equal to the reference" however this is not borne out in all cases (sometimes the Deliverable Obligation is NOT the Reference Obligation. This term is what we are referrring to when we refer to the credit event. This is what you are referencing to determine whether or not a default has occurred. Note: Loans as Reference Obligation: If the Ref Ob is a loan you can't establish that a default event has occurred but would have to specify some other event that can be obvserved to objectively determine that there has been a default. For example, you might have a loan for a company but monitor a bond issued by that company. If the bond defaults, the deliverable obligation may be the loan or some cash settlement based on the value of that loan (more typically). Detailed Review Notes: Q: Where does it go from here: thing or event? A: Commonly refers to an instrument, i.e. "This is the instrument we are looking at; if this instrument defaults then we are going to pay out on the protection leg.

Answers: This is the "other" side of the swap from credit protection, i.e. the payment side. You are going to pay a set of fixed payments in return for a payment that occurs in the event of the credit event. So this is not incorrect but not a useful name for it. Swap is swap of a set of payments that equates the credit margin in return for the payments that apply in the case of the credit event. Conclusions: A good name for it might be the Credit Margin, at least from the point of view of the protection buyer, as this is the margin they are paying for the credit protection.</skos:editorialNote>

    <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Review notes 31 March: For a protection leg the commitment is a conditional commitment to pay out in the event of the credit event. Typically this would be a default. Contingent Leg is another name for this, because it is contingent on the credit event. Contents: 1. The payment to be made in the event of the credit event occurring 2. the Credit Event itself. This is called the calculation amount as it is the notional amount minus the recovery, to get a final calculation amount. There is a formula behind this. The Calculation Amount is how the calculation is driven not what the actual payment amount is. Do we model the formula? Depends whether there is physical or cash settlement. Modeler notes: FpML terms for "CDS Protection Terms" are equivalent to this structure. Formal Definition for CDS Protection Terms: The legal terms relevant to defining the applicable floating rate payer calculation amount, credit events and associated conditions to settlement, and reference obligations. FpML: 'This element contains all the terms relevant to defining the applicable floating rate payer calculation amount, credit events and associated conditions to settlement, and reference obligations.'
