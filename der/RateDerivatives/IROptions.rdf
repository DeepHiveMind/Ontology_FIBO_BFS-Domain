    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A strip of options in which interest payable in each period is either the Observable (Underlying) rate or the Strike rate, at the holder's discretion, and in which the Strike rate represents a rate above which the holder can elect not to pay.</skos:definition>
    <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Definition and editorial note against the property 'strike effect' for this class (property is now a restriction): The Strike rate is to be subtracted from the Observable rate on the reset date, to determine the settlement amount. REVIEW SESSION NOTES: This is incorrect. Cap applies to borrower. the Cap is the max amount I will pay to borrow. I take a capped rate. I am the buyer of the option. The market rate this time is higher than the capped rate. You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled. Name: "Cap" Loan one: Cap talks about a maximum interest rate payable by the holder, so the holder pays an amount each time, up to a maximum which is the Cap rate. Name: "Capped Loan" What manner of thin is this? A loan. Its ancestors are not OTC derivatives contracts thet are Loan.</skos:editorialNote>
    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The interest in each period is effectively capped by the Strike rate. That is, the rate of interest may not go above the Strike rate because the Holder is expected to exercise the option to take the Strike as the rate of interest instead.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A strip or sequential set of options with periodic reset dates, such that each period between resets behaves like an individual option (known as a Caplet or Floorlet).</skos:definition>
    <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">The defining fact is that it is a set of sequential options. So in principal this is a strip of any kind of option. Can you strip forwards? In principal, but usually you would have a Commodity Swap which would be a strip of Forwards. Other strips? Don't always buy a string of caplets and floorlets but buy an individual cap or floor. for IR Options These are always Caps or Floors, that is the option settlement takes the form of the difference between the Strike rate and the designated underlying (observable) rate on the stated dates. Review notes: caps and floors are always strips, but there are strips for other assets as well. SO: There are strips besides Options; There are Option Strips besides IR (Cap and Floor) ones. See eg. in France where you may have a strip of options where the strike is set at each rollover. Details to come by email. In this case it would be an asset option, specifically Equity.</skos:editorialNote>
