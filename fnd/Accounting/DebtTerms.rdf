    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Funds loaned or extended from one party to another for some purpose. Further notes: This is a loan or a debt security principal amount. This term is distinguished from "Debt" or "Credit" in that the latter are balances at a point in time; however it is also referred to as debt for example in debt securities, since a loaned or securitized amount constitutes a debt when it is advanced (and ceases to constitute a debt when it is paid off). As such, this usually has interest payable and may have collateral. In Islamic products there is no interest. This may be a loan (realized as a draw-down on a credit facillity) or it may be a debt set up as part of the issuance of a debt security.</skos:definition>

    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This is an amount of money regarded as a debt by one party, or as credit by another party. Note that the sub terms Credit and Debt are also balance sheet entries, that is these can be anything in which monies are owed by one party to another. Monies Owing may therefore also be goods payable/receivable. This term is therefore independent of the existence of any formal credit facility provided by a credit provider. Change note Reviewed 18 Oct 2012 and determined that Monies Owing is a mediating thing (context0 in which Credit and Debt are defined, and not a common parent of those two things. Credit and Debt changed to be sub classes of Relative Thing and not cub classes of Monies Owing as before. New relationship fact 'viewpoint' added to Credit and similarly to Debt, with Monies Owing as the target of that fact, in place of the previous superclass relationship.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Further notes: This is not the balance of the debt at a point in time, but the amount drawn down at a specific point in time, after which (for interest bearing debts) interest becomes payable. Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a "Referenceable Archetype" meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization.</skos:definition>
