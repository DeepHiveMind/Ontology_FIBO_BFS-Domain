    >Definition: An occurrent with no interval Explanatory Note: This is an occurrent which is described in terms of it being instant; however, in reality such a description depends upon the definition of some temporal unit in terms of which this is considered a unit, such as a day or a second/ Editorial note: This allows us to talk about concepts which are defined with reference to an instant, where that instant may be a day or an hour or some other unit. The nature of many concepts in financial services is that they frame something as an instant at one or another scale, for example the day on which some instrument. Explanatory Note: Whenever we call something an instant we say so with reference to some unit of measure.</skos:definition>
