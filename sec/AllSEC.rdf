		<rdfs:label>EDMC Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) Securities (SEC) Domain, Version 2.0</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>The &apos;all&apos; ontology for SEC ontology is provided for convenience for FIBO users.  This ontology does not add new assertions, but imports most of the Production (Released) ontologies that comprise the FIBO Foundations (FND), Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), and Securities (SEC) domains, excluding individuals for governments and jurisdictions, financial services, regulatory organizations and related registries, and reference individuals, as well as the LCC region-specific ontologies.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:definition>individual representing metadata about the FIBO Securities (SEC), Version 2.0 Domain</skos:definition>
		<skos:historyNote>Revisions to the FIBO Securities (SEC) Domain and related ontologies are managed per the process outlined in the Policies and Procedures for OMG standards, with the intent to maintain backwards compatibility in the ontologies to the degree possible.
  
The RDF/XML serialized OWL for the Foundations ODM/OWL ontologies have been checked for syntactic errors and logical consistency with Protege 5.2 (http://protege.stanford.edu/), HermiT 1.3.8 (http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) and Pellet 2.2 (http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/).</skos:historyNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>Users should be aware that the SEC ontologies depend on the ontologies specified in the EDMC-FIBO Foundations (FND), Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), and Indices and Indicators (IND) domains, and as such, this ontology imports most of FND, BE, FBC, and IND, in addition to most of SEC.  It is useful for importing the entire set of ontologies as the basis for other development, in other words. Individual ontologies within SEC only import those on which they directly depend.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
