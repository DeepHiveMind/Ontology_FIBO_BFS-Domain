    <h1>EDM Council FIBO Ontology</h1>

    The FIBO ontology is best viewed using a dedicated ontology tool. We include instructions here for three popular tools, <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a>, <a href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/">TopBraid Composer</a> and <a href="https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/cameo-concept-modeler-plugin">CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</a>.  See below for detailed instructions for loading FIBO in each of these tools. 

    <h2><a name="Using">Using FIBO</h2>
    <p>
      The FIBO Ontology is available online using the
      <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/follow-your-nose.html"><i>follow-your-nose</i></a> pattern.
      This means that tools that use this pattern can read FIBO directly from the web.
      This ensures that you are always viewing the latest version of FIBO.
      Keep in mind, that when viewing FIBO in this way, that any edits you make to FIBO will only be reflected in
      your own copy, and won't be saved for others to see.
      <p>FIBO is also available for offline use by downloading a .zip of the current state.
      FIBO is updated every three months, so any such offline downloaded version will quickly be out of date.</p>
      FIBO is published using the Web Ontology Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">OWL</a>).
      There are a number of tools available, both commercial and open source, that can read and edit FIBO.
      We provide instructions for the most common ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Using FIBO online</h3>
    <h4>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h4>
    <p>
    	Please use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 5.2 or higher.
	 <p/>
      <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> is an open-source ontology editor that can be used to
      view and edit FIBO.  Prot&eacute;g&eacute; works well in online mode, so you can point it to an AboutFIBO file,
      and it will load the rest.
      <ol>
	<li>In Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, select File>Open from URL</li>
	<li>Copy and Paste the URL for the AboutFIBO.rdf file from the version you desire; https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBODev.rdf for the development version or https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBOProd.rdf for the production version</li>
      </ol>
      Prot&eacute;g&eacute; will find and load all the FIBO files from the currently published version (for the selected version).
    </p>
    <h4>TopBraid Composer</h4>
    <p>
      At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into TopBraid Composer.
    </p>
    <h4>CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</h4>
    <p>
      At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into CCM. 
    </p>
</p>
<h3>Using FIBO offline</h3>
<h4>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h4>
<p>
	 Please use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 5.2 or higher.
	 <p/>
  <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a> format.
  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in RDF/XML and load it into Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org. You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/dev.rdf.zip">Development</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/prod.rdf.zip">Production</a> version. </li>
    <li>Unzip this to your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the FIBO
      ontologies in subdirectories.
    </li>
    <li>Open Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 
    </li>
    <li>Select File>Open, and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO.
      Navigate to AboutFIBODev.rdf or AboutFiboProd.rdf (development and production, respectively), and select it. </li
						   <li>Protege will open all relevant FIBO files. </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/">TopBraid Composer</a></h4>
<p>
  TopBraid Composer prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">RDF Turtle</a> format.
  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in Turtle and load it into TopBraid:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in Turtle from spec.edmcouncil.org.  You'll need to specify which maturity
      level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/dev.ttl.zip">Development</a>
      version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/prod.ttl.zip">Production</a> version. </li>
    <li>Unzip this on your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the
      FIBO ontologies in subdirectories. </li>
    <li>Open TopBraid Composer.  Create a project (File>New>Project) called <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the <i>fibo</i> directory from your filesystem onto the project <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>
  in the TopBraid Composer Navigator pane.  If prompted, select "Copy files"</li>
<li>Navigate through the fibo directory in the Navigator pane to fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBODev.ttl or fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBOProd.ttl (development and production, respectively)  Double-click on AboutFIBO.ttl to open all FIBO files.  
</ol>
<h4>No Magic CCM Cameo Concept Modeler</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/cameo-concept-modeler-plugin">CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</a>
  imports both the RDF/XML and Turtle TTL formats,  and pulls the ontology into a 'UML-like' model of the
  ontology, which is then ready to use.
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org . You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the development version or the production version.</li>
    <li>Unzip this to your hard drive. This creates a single directory called fibo, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories.</li>
    <li>Open MagicDraw with the CCM plugin installed. </li>
    <li>In MagicDraw, create a new project:  File/New Project/  and name it.</li>
    <li>Import the FIBO Master:  File/Import From/OWL Ontology File,  and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO. Navigate to AboutFIBODev.rdf, or AboutFIBOProd.ttl, depending on your preference, and import it.</li>
    MagicDraw will import all of FIBO ontologies contained in the AboutFIBO file.
  </ol>
  <b>Note:</b> FIBO makes reference to <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/">LCC (Languages, Countries and Codes)</a>
  from the OMG, which includes information about these things from other standards bodies.
  When you load FIBO, all these tools will find these files via follow-your-nose.
  If you cannot reach these files on the omg.org web servers for any reason, you will see load errors for the files it
  couldn't find.  These can be safely ignored, but you will not have details of the Languages, Countries and Codes available in your model.
