A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed.

Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don't know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the 'index' (we don't call it that here) is a basket of securities.","A kind of realized variable swap side terms.

par value,Property,,"A dollar amount that is assigned to a security when representing the value contributed for each share in cash or goods. (definition from Investor Words) Further notes: from Wikipedia: Par value is a nominal value of a security which is determined by an issuer company at a minimum price. Par value of an equity (a stock) is a somewhat archaic concept. The par value of a stock was the share price upon initial offering; the issuing company promised not to issue further shares below par value, so investors could be confident that no one else was receiving a more favorable issue price. This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today. Most common stocks issued today do not have par values; those that do (usually only in jurisdictions where par values are required by law) have extremely low par values (often the smallest unit of currency commonly used), for example a penny par value on a stock issued at USD$25/share. Most states do not allow a company to issue stock below par value. No-par stocks have no par value printed on its certificates. Instead of par value, some U.S. states allow no-par stocks to have a stated value, set by the board of directors of the corporation, which serves the same purpose as par value in setting the minimum legal capital that the corporation must have after paying any dividends or buying back its stock.",A property that is used by the class share.
