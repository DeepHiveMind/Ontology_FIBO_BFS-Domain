    <h1>EDM Council FIBO Glossary</h1>
    <p>
      Generated from the OWL, the FIBO glossary is a list of classes and properties defined in FIBO, including their logical definition, curated natural language definition and synonyms where available.  As with all of FIBO, there is a Production version of the Glossary, which includes definitions of terms that have been vetted by the FIBO content teams, as well as a Development version, which includes terms that are currently being developed.

      There are 3 ways to work with the FIBO Glossary.

<ol>
<li>	<a href="#WS">Web Searchable</a></li>
<li>	<a href="#CSV">Downloadable as a .csv for working in a spreadsheet</a></li>
<li>	<a href="#XLS">Downloadable as a .xls for working in a spreadsheet</a></li>
</ol>



<h2><a name="WS">Web Searchable </a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="production.html">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="development.html">Development</a></li>
</ul>
A user-friendly web page that includes label, curated defintion, synonyms (where available) and model-generated defintions for all classes and properties in FIBO. 
<p>Example:</p>
<img border="1" src="../image/glossary1.png" width="80%"/>

 
<h2><a name="CSV">Comma Separated Values format</a></h2>
A comma-separated file with the same information as the web page; label, curated defintion, synonyms and model-generated defintion.  For use in spreadsheets, including Excel.  
<ul>
  <li><a href="javascript:current('../../fibo/glossary/master/CURRENT/glossaryP.csv')">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="javascript:current('../../fibo/glossary/master/CURRENT/glossaryD.csv')">Development</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="XLS">Excel format</a></h2>
A file that can be read with Microsof Excel, conaining the same information as above; label, curated defintion, synonyms and model-generated defintion.  Exclusively for use with Excel, this file includes formatting to make the spreadsheet easier to read. 
Note: Excel may complain when the .csv or .xls files are opened.  We know of no actual problem that this causes. 
<ul>
  <li><a href="javascript:current('../../fibo/glossary/master/CURRENT/glossaryP.xls')">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="javascript:current('../../fibo/glossary/master/CURRENT/glossaryD.xls')">Development</a></li>
 </ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<img border="1" src="../image/glossary2.png" width="80%"/>
