<body>
<p>
The EDM Council intends to publish FIBO quarterly on <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo">https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo</a>.
This will include 400 Plus files that are all of the 30 Financial Industry Domain/subdomain ontologies that have been
being developed for many years.
</p>
<p>
Much of these 30 Domains will serve as raw content to be further expanded and refined by Subject Matter Experts using
the FIBO Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology.
</p>
<p>
Of immediate importance, within these 30 Domains and Subdomains are 8 Domains that have been vetted by SMEs, and have
passed standard industry Hygiene tests for Web Ontology Language (OWL) content.
</p>
<p>In addition to content, spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo will contain an open source package of applications named the RDF ToolKit.
This will enable both casual and expert users to pick and choose FIBO content and how they want to visualize and use that content.
spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo and the RDF ToolKit are works in process.
</p>
<p>
The EDM Council welcomes and encourages participation from users and developers.
