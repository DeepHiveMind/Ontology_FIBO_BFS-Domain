    <h2>FIBO</h2>
    <p>
<p>FIBO is intended for a range of users including in its simplest form as an English language
Glossary that could be used to inform a bank or a regulator's Data Dictionary, or the actual FIBO
Data Dictionary could be repurposed as a bank or regulators Data Dictionary. In its most
complex form, FIBO in its native Web Ontology Language (OWL), could be used as a bank's
operational ontology. There are also those external uses of FIBO such as FIBO.schema.org
which uses FIBO as a reference to find specific information on the Internet. The FIBO
Primer provides a layman's version of what is FIBO and how to use its content.</p>
<p>To serve this wide array of users, FIBO is published quarterly on https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo as a
variety of products in file formats and dialects ranging from HTML to JSON-LD. There distinct
products for different interests and purposes. All are generated, or derived from the FIBO
RDF/OWL System of Record using the Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology in a continuous
development process governed by automation including the Council developed open source
RDF ToolKit, GitHub, Jenkins, SourceTree and a number of Wiki's for collaboration.</p>
<p>FIBO currently consists of core Finance Industry domains including Securities and Equities,
Loans and more, in 49 modules and more than 400 ontology files. Each Product is published in
two releases on https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo. They are FIBO Development and FIBO Production.
FIBO Production is published at the end of each calendar quarter. FIBO Production content has
been vetted by SMEs, and has passed standard industry Hygiene tests for Web Ontology
Language (OWL) content. FIBO Development is published in real time as changes are accepted
by the FIBO Leadership Team.</p>
<p>The EDM Council welcomes and encourages participation from users and developers. But to
