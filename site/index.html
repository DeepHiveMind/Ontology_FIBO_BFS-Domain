    <h2>FIBO</h2>
    <p>
    The EDM Council is publishing FIBO quarterly on <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo">https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo</a>.
    This includes 400 Plus files that are all of the 30 Financial Industry Domain/subdomain ontologies that have been 
    being developed for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
    Much of these 30 Domains will serve as raw content to be further expanded and refined by Subject Matter Experts using
    the FIBO <a href="https://www.edmcouncil.org/downloads/2015_06_30_EDMC_FIBO_build_test_deploy_maintain.pdf">Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology</a> in a continuous development process goverened by automation including the Council 
    developed open source RDF ToolKit, GitHub, Jenkins, SourceTree and a number of Wiki's for collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of immediate importance, within these 30 Domains and Subdomains are 8 Domains that have been vetted by SMEs, and have
    passed standard industry Hygiene tests for Web Ontology Language (OWL) content.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to content, spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo will contain a FIBO Navigator.
    This will enable both casual and expert users to pick and choose FIBO content and how they want to visualize and use that content.
    spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo and the FIBO Navigator are works in process.
    </p>
    <p>
    The EDM Council welcomes and encourages participation from users and developers.  Look around:
