<h2>Using FIBO</h2>

<p>
The FIBO publication incudes many products.   The main product is FIBO itself, the Financial Industry Business Ontology (in OWL).  Other products that are derived from or developed in conjunction with FIBO are
<ul>
<li>FIBO Vocabulary - A machine-readable dictionary of terms in FIBO (in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>)</li>
<li>FIBO Glossary - A human-readable, cross-referenced dictionary of terms in FIBO (in HTML)</li>
<li>FIBO Models - Machine- and human-readable UML diagrams of FIBO (using <a href="">SMIF</a></li>
<li>schema.org - A vocabulary for marking up web pages with terms taken from FIBO</li>
</ul>

The FIBO Ontology is available online in follow-your-nose format; this means that any ontology in FIBO can be fetched by resolving its Ontology resource URI.  This will return a file in RDF/XML format that contains all term definitions in the Ontology. 

FIBO is also available for offline use by downloading a .zip of the current state.  FIBO is updated every three months, so any such offline downloaded version will quickly be out of date. 

FIBO is published using the Web Ontology Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">OWL</a>).  There are a number of tools available, both commercial and open source, that can read and edit FIBO.  We provide instructions for the most common ones.  

<h3>Using FIBO online</h3>
<h4>Protégé</h4>
<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a> is an open-source ontology editor that can be used to view and edit FIBO.  Protégé works well in offline mode, so you can point it to the AboutFIBO file, and it will load the rest. 
<ol>
<li>In Protégé, select File>Open from URL</li>
<li>Paste in the URL for the AboutFIBO file from the version you desire; <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBO.rdf">alpha</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/pink/latest/AboutFIBO.rdf">release</a></li>
</ol>
Protégé will find and load all the FIBO files from the currentlly published version. 
<h4>TopBraid Composer</h4>

<h3>Using FIBO offline</h3>
<h4>Protégé</h4>
<h4><a href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/">TopBraid Composer</a></h4>
TopBraid Composer prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">RDF Turtle</a> format.  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in Turtle and load it into TopBraid:

<ol>
<li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in Turtle from spec.edmcouncil.org.  You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/latest.ttl.zip">alpha</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/pink/latest/latest.ttl.zip">release</a> version. </li>
<li>Unzip this on your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories. </li>
<li>Open TopBraid Composer.  Create a project (File>New>Project) called <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>.</li>  
<li>Drag and drop the <i>fibo</i> directory from your filesystem onto the project <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i> in the TopBraid Composer Navigator pane.  If prompted, select "Copy files"</li>
<li>Navigate through the fibo directory in the Navigator pane until you find AboutFIBO.ttl (it is in the directory fibo/ontology/master/latest for the latest alpha, and in fibo/ontology/release/latest for the release version.  Double-click on AboutFIBO.ttl to open all FIBO files. 
</ol>


<b>Note:</b> FIBO makes reference to <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/">LCC (Languages, Countries and Codes)</a> from the OMG, which includes information about these things from other standards bodies.  If you just load FIBO from the edmcouncil web site, you will be missing these, and TopBraid will warn you about the files it can't fine.  These warnings can be safely ignored, but you will be missing some information about Languages, Countries and Codes.
