    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
FIBO is being developed in a continuous process by FIBO Content Teams (FCT) within the FIBO <a href="doc/20170930_FIBO_BTDM.pdf">Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology</a>. All of FIBO is continuously published with the maturity level indicated as Development. This is all FIBO Domains. In addition, FIBO is published at the end of each calendar quarter in a maturity level indicated as Production. FIBO Production is FIBO Domains that have been substantially vetted and tested. This FIBO publication includes Production content in Foundations (FND), Financial Business Concepts (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), Business Entities (BE), Securities and Equities (SEC) and Loans (LOAN). All other content, including parts of these domains, in published FIBO Development are for information only, and should not be relied upon except as raw material. Please see <a href="../static/ontology/index.html#Using">Using FIBO</a> for instructions on how to use FIBO. You may also want to look at the <a href="doc/20171231_FIBO_Primer.pdf">FIBO Primer</a> for a layman's description of what FIBO is and how to use its content.  
<p/>
FIBO Domains in <a href="http://www.omg.org/">OWL</a> are also available as <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/">OMG</a> specs for FND, FBC, BE and IND.
<p/>

Today, FIBO is available as the products below, with more soon to follow. All FIBO products are generated or derived from the W3C OWL System of Record. Be aware that flaws in the OWL will be reflected in all other products. 
We are making all of FIBO available now because we have already seen amazing work done with FIBO and we welcome, almost demand - your feedback.
