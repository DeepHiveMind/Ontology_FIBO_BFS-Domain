      EDM Council - FIBO
    </h1>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
FIBO is being developed in a continuous process by FIBO Content Teams (FCT) within the FIBO <a href="../doc/20170930BDTM.pdf">Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology</a>. All of FIBO is publised at the end of each calendar quarter with the maturity level indicated as Development. This is all 30 FIBO Domains. In addition, FIBO is published in a maturity level indicated as Production. FIBO Production is FIBO Domains that have been substantialy vetted and tested. This FIBO publication includes Production content in Foundations (FND), Financial Business Concepts (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), Business Entities (BE), Securities and Equities (SEC) and Loans. All other content, including parts of these domains, in published FIBO Development are for information only, and should not be relied upon except as raw material.  Please see <a href="#Using">Using FIBO</a> (below) for instructions on how to use FIBO. 
<p/>
FIBO Domains in <a href="http://www.omg.org/">OWL</a> are also available as <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/">OMG</a> specs for FND, FBC, BE and IND.
<p/>

Today, FIBO is available as the five products below, with more soon to follow. All FIBO products are generated or derived from the W3C OWL System of Record. Be aware that flaws in the OWL will be reflected in all other products. 
We are making all of FIBO available now because we have already seen amazing work done with FIBO and we welcome, almost demand - your feedback.

To increase the availability of FIBO triples from our Linked Data Fragment server are available <a href="http://fragments.edmcouncil.org/">here</a>.  A linked data fragment  client can be pointed to that location, one can obtain a client and server implementation <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">here</a>.
The purpose of this server is to enable intelligent clients that can process triples in client side SPARQL. A triple pattern specification is very lightweight, and still allows SPARQL endpoint like access of data. One can look at this protocol method as sitting between a full RDF dump file and a SPARQL endpoint. Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.  It is planned to offer client implementation from this server after some further testing and finding some handy queries to prepopulate.
 Other fragments servers in production can be found <a href="">here</a>.

      The FIBO Ontology is available online using the
      <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/follow-your-nose.html"><i>follow-your-nose</i></a> pattern.
      This means that tools that use this pattern can read FIBO directly from the web.
      This ensures that you are always viewing the latest version of FIBO.
      Keep in mind, that when viewing FIBO in this way, that any edits you make to FIBO will only be reflected in
      your own copy, and won't be saved for others to see.
      FIBO is also available for offline use by downloading a .zip of the current state.
      FIBO is updated every three months, so any such offline downloaded version will quickly be out of date.
      FIBO is published using the Web Ontology Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">OWL</a>).
      There are a number of tools available, both commercial and open source, that can read and edit FIBO.
      We provide instructions for the most common ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Using FIBO online</h3>
    <h4>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h4>
    <p>
    	Please use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 5.2 or higher.
	 <p/>
      <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> is an open-source ontology editor that can be used to
      view and edit FIBO.  Prot&eacute;g&eacute; works well in online mode, so you can point it to an AboutFIBO file,
      and it will load the rest.
      <ol>
	<li>In Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, select File>Open from URL</li>
	<li>Copy and Paste the URL for the AboutFIBO.rdf file from the version you desire; https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBODev.rdf for the development version or https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBOProd.rdf for the production version</li>
      </ol>
      Prot&eacute;g&eacute; will find and load all the FIBO files from the currently published version (for the selected version).
    </p>
    <h4>TopBraid Composer</h4>
    <p>
      At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into TopBraid Composer.
    </p>
</p>
<h3>Using FIBO offline</h3>
<h4>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</h4>
<p>
	 Please use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 5.2 or higher.
	 <p/>
  <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a> format.
  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in RDF/XML and load it into Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org. You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/dev.rdf.zip">Development</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/prod.rdf.zip">Production</a> version. </li>
    <li>Unzip this to your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the FIBO
      ontologies in subdirectories.
    </li>
    <li>Open Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 
    </li>
    <li>Select File>Open, and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO.
      Navigate to AboutFIBODev.rdf or AboutFiboProd.rdf (development and production, respectively), and select it. </li
						   <li>Protege will open all relevant FIBO files. </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/">TopBraid Composer</a></h4>
<p>
  TopBraid Composer prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">RDF Turtle</a> format.
  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in Turtle and load it into TopBraid:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in Turtle from spec.edmcouncil.org.  You'll need to specify which maturity
      level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/dev.ttl.zip">Development</a>
      version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/prod.ttl.zip">Production</a> version. </li>
    <li>Unzip this on your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the
      FIBO ontologies in subdirectories. </li>
    <li>Open TopBraid Composer.  Create a project (File>New>Project) called <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the <i>fibo</i> directory from your filesystem onto the project <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>
  in the TopBraid Composer Navigator pane.  If prompted, select "Copy files"</li>
<li>Navigate through the fibo directory in the Navigator pane to fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBODev.ttl or fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBOProd.ttl (development and production, respectively)  Double-click on AboutFIBO.ttl to open all FIBO files.  
</ol>
<h4>No Magic CCM Cameo Concept Modeler</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/cameo-concept-modeler-plugin">CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</a>
  imports both the RDF/XML and Turtle TTL formats,  and pulls the ontology into a 'UML-like' model of the
  ontology, which is then ready to use.
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org . You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the development version or the production version.</li>
    <li>Unzip this to your hard drive. This creates a single directory called fibo, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories.</li>
    <li>Open MagicDraw with the CCM plugin installed. </li>
    <li>In MagicDraw, create a new project:  File/New Project/  and name it.</li>
    <li>Import the FIBO Master:  File/Import From/OWL Ontology File,  and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO. Navigate to AboutFIBODev.rdf, or AboutFIBOProd.ttl, depending on your preference, and import it.</li>
    MagicDraw will import all of FIBO ontologies contained in the AboutFIBO file.
  </ol>
  <b>Note:</b> FIBO makes reference to <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/">LCC (Languages, Countries and Codes)</a>
  from the OMG, which includes information about these things from other standards bodies.
  When you load FIBO, all these tools will find these files via follow-your-nose.
  If your network does no allow you to reach the omg.org web servers, you will see load errors for the files it
  couldn't find.

<h2><a name="allformats">All supported formats</a></h2>
<p>FIBO (both Production and Development releases) and FIBO-V (Development only; Production coming soon) are available in a number of RDF formats.
