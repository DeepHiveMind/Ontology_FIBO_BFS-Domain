    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
FIBO is being developed in a continuous process by FIBO Content Teams (FCT) within the FIBO <a href="doc/20170930_FIBO_BTDM.pdf">Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology</a>. All of FIBO is continuously published with the maturity level indicated as Development. This is all 11 FIBO Domains. In addition, FIBO is published at the end of each calendar quarter in a maturity level indicated as Production. FIBO Production is FIBO Domains that have been substantially vetted and tested. This FIBO publication includes Production content in Foundations (FND), Financial Business Concepts (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), Business Entities (BE), Securities and Equities (SEC) and Loans (LOAN). All other content, including parts of these domains, in published FIBO Development are for information only, and should not be relied upon except as raw material. Please see <a href="#Using">Using FIBO</a> (below) for instructions on how to use FIBO. You may also want to look at the <a href="doc/20170930_FIBO_Primer.pdf">FIBO Primer</a> for a layman's description of what FIBO is and how to use its content.  
<p/>
FIBO Domains in <a href="http://www.omg.org/">OWL</a> are also available as <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/">OMG</a> specs for FND, FBC, BE and IND.
<p/>

Today, FIBO is available as the eight products below, with more soon to follow. All FIBO products are generated or derived from the W3C OWL System of Record. Be aware that flaws in the OWL will be reflected in all other products. 
We are making all of FIBO available now because we have already seen amazing work done with FIBO and we welcome, almost demand - your feedback.

        <td>
To increase the availability of FIBO triples from our Linked Data Fragment server are available <a href="http://fragments.edmcouncil.org/">here</a>.  A linked data fragment  client can be pointed to that location, one can obtain a client and server implementation <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">here</a>.
The purpose of this server is to enable intelligent clients that can process triples in client side SPARQL. A triple pattern specification is very lightweight, and still allows SPARQL endpoint like access of data. One can look at this protocol method as sitting between a full RDF dump file and a SPARQL endpoint. Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.  It is planned to offer client implementation from this server after some further testing and finding some handy queries to prepopulate.
 Other fragments servers in production can be found <a href="http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/">here</a>.
