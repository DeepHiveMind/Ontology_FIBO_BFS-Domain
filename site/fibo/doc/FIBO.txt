      FIBO
    </h1>
    <p>
FIBO is intended for a range of users including in its simplist form as an English language Glossary that could be used to inform a bank of a regulator's Data Dictionary, or the actual FIBO Data Dictionary could be
repurposed as a bank or regulators Data Dictionary. In its most complex form, FIBO in its native Web Ontology Language (OWL), could be used as a bank's operational ontology. There are also those external uses of
FIBO such as FIBO.schema.org which uses FIBO as a referance to find specific information on the Internet. The <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/doc/20170930_FIBO_Primer.pdf">FIBO Primer</a> provides a
layman's version of what is FIBO ad how to use its content.
