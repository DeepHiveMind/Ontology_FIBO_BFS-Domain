http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/Languages/LanguageRepresentation/<b>Alpha3Code</b><span class='comment'> /*&nbsp;</span><span class='active-entity'>note</span> <span class='literal'>"The language codes consist of three Latin-alphabet characters in lowercase. No diacritical marks or modified characters are used.  Implementors should be aware that these codes are not intended to be an abbreviation for the language, but to serve as a device to identify a given language or group of languages.  Thus, in this ontology, alpha-3 code is modeled as a subclass of designation rather than abbreviation, which might seem more natural.  The language codes are derived from the language name.
     Two code sets are provided in ISO 639-2, one for bibliographic applications (ISO 639-2&47;B), and one for terminology applications (ISO 639-2&47;T). Some of these are considered collective language codes, referring to a family of languages, and there are a few special purpose codes for use in various applications. ISO 639-3 provides a single, three character code for each individual language or macrolanguage. Additional codes for language families and groups may be specified in anticipated forthcoming parts of the standard."</span> (<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">string</a>)<span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>

The criteria for identifying distinct languages in the case of varieties that have gone extinct in recent times are as defined above. In the case of ancient languages, a criterion based on intelligibility would be ideal, but in the final analysis, identifiers will be assigned to ancient languages which have a distinct literature and are treated distinctly by the scholarly community. In order to qualify for inclusion in this code, the language must have an attested literature or be well-documented as a language known to have been spoken by some particular community at some point in history.  It may not be a reconstructed language inferred from historical comparative analysis. The code also includes identifiers that denote historic languages that are considered to be distinct from any modern languages that may be descended from them, for instance, Old English and Middle English. Here, too, the criterion is that the language must have a literature that is treated distinctly by the scholarly community."</span> (<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">string</a>)<span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>

http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/Languages/LanguageRepresentation/<b>IndividualLanguage</b><span class='comment'> /*&nbsp;</span><span class='active-entity'>note</span> <span class='literal'>"Identifiers in Parts 1, 2, and 3 of ISO 639 are assumed to denote distinct individual languages, unless the language name explicitly refers to a language group.

There is no one definition of a 'language' that is agreed upon by all and appropriate for all purposes. As a result, there can be disagreement, even among speakers of the language or experts in linguistics, as to whether two variants represent dialects of a single language or two distinct languages. For ISO 639, judgments regarding when two variants are considered to be the same or different languages are based on a number of factors, including linguistic similarity, intelligibility, a common literature, the views of speakers concerning the relationship between language and identity, and other factors. The following basic criteria are followed.
 - Two related variants are normally considered variants of the same language if speakers of each variant have inherent understanding of the other variant (that is, can understand based on knowledge of their own variant without needing to learn the other variant) at a functional level.
 - Where spoken intelligibility between variants is marginal, the existence of a common literature or of a common ethnolinguistic identity with a central variant that both understand can be strong indicators that they should nevertheless be considered variants of the same language.
 - Where there is enough intelligibility between variants to enable communication, the existence of well-established
distinct ethnolinguistic identities can be a strong indicator that they should nevertheless be considered to be different languages.
Some of the distinctions made on this basis may not be considered appropriate by some users or for certain
applications. However, these basic criteria are thought to best fit the intended range of applications."</span> (<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">string</a>)<span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>

Parts 1 and 3 provide identifiers for individual languages and macrolanguages only. Some of the code elements in Part 2 specify remainder groups. These items have the word 'other' in their English names (and 'autres' in their French names). The same alpha-3 identifiers are included in Part 5 of ISO 639 denoting the language group or family as a whole. For applications using Part 2 only, the remainder group identifiers shall be used for languages that belong to the language group or family in question, but that do not have an individual-language identifier in Part 2. Applications using Parts 2 and 5 and applications using Parts 2 and 3 and 5 shall use the collective language code elements in the sense specified in Part 5, allowing for hierarchies of language identifiers."</span> (<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">string</a>)<span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>

http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/Languages/LanguageRepresentation/<b>Macrolanguage</b><span class='comment'> /*&nbsp;</span><span class='active-entity'>note</span> <span class='literal'>"Parts 1 and 2 of ISO 639 include identifiers that correspond in a one-to-many manner with individual language identifiers in Part 3 of ISO 639. For instance, Part 3 of ISO 639 contains over 30 identifiers designated as individual language identifiers for distinct variants of Arabic, while Parts 1 and 2 each contain only one identifier for Arabic, 'ar' and 'ara' respectively, which are designated as individual language identifiers in those parts of ISO 639. It is assumed here that the single identifiers for Arabic in Parts 1 and 2 of ISO 639 correspond to the many identifiers collectively for distinct variants of Arabic in Part 3 of ISO 639.

In this example, it may appear that the single identifiers in Parts 1 and 2 of ISO 639 should be designated as collective language identifiers. That is not assumed, however. In various parts of the world, there are clusters of closely-related language variants that, based on the criteria discussed in 4.2, can be considered individual languages, yet in certain usage contexts a single language identity for all is needed. Typical situations in which this need can occur include the following.
 - There is one variant that is more developed and that tends to be used for wider communication by speakers of various closely-related languages; as a result, there is a perceived common linguistic identity across these languages. For instance, there are several distinct spoken Arabic languages, but Standard Arabic is generally used in business and media across all of these communities, and is also an important aspect of a shared ethno-religious unity. As a result, a perceived common linguistic identity exists.
 - There is a common written form used for multiple closely-related languages. For instance, multiple Chinese languages share a common written form.
 - There is a transitional sociolinguistic situation in which sub-communities of a single language community are diverging, creating a need for some purposes to recognise distinct languages while, for other purposes, a single common identity is still valid. For instance, in some business contexts it is necessary to make a distinction between the languages Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; yet there are other contexts in which these distinctions are not discernable in language resources that are in use.

Where such situations exist, an identifier for the single, common language identity is considered to be a macrolanguage identifier.

Macrolanguages are distinguished from language groups in that the individual languages that correspond to a macrolanguage must be very closely related, and there must be some domain in which only a single language identity is recognized."</span> (<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">string</a>)<span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>
