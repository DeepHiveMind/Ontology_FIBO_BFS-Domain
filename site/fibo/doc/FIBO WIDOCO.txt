     EDM Council FIBO Ontology Browser

  <p>
The Wizard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO) displays FIBO as a set of interlinked documents for each component ontology,
along with an interacting diagram of the classes and relationships in the ontology.
</p>

The WIDOCO documentation includes a <i><a hef="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/widoco/master/latest/vowltreeProd.html"<Production</a>)</i> version,
with definitions of classes an dproperties that have been vetted by the FIBO content teams, as well as a <i><a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/widoco/master/latest/vowltreeDev.html"<Development</a>)</i> version,
which includes classes an dproperties that are currently being developed.
</p>

A search on any Class that has the word VOWL after it, will usuallu return a very complicated bubble chart as in the example below.

</p>

What we have found as a good practice is:
1) Set the degree of collapsing to 0
2) Zoom out - using two finger motion (down) or mouse wheel
3) You should see the local classes in light blue
4) Type the class you are searching for in the search box. It gets highlighted in Red. (For corporation's ontology try - joint stock company as in the example below)
5) You can zoom in to the specific area.
