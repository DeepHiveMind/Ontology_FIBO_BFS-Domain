    >Review notes (Q2 2011) This is a Role. Change accordingly. This is the role an entity may be playing in a transaction. This will be in the Transactions model when done. Example agent in tri party RePo, may not be involved in the contract but is effecting the settlement between the two separate entities. Example we started with was when dealing with a specific copany but needing to know the location you are dealing with, e.g. settling with a different branch i.e. have to send to a different bank account. Decision: Hold till we do Transactions - there's brokers, traders, settlement clearing institutions and so on. Binds to the concept of location. Additional notes for the next update: Definition and notes captured against "Legal Entity has Settlement Entity": The entity with which settlement of transactions with the entity is to be settled, if this is not the entire entity. See March 30, 2011 notes for origin of this concept</skos:editorialNote>

    >No facts are modeled about this at present, and it may not be realistic to model this semantically other than to define the entity in words and refer to it. Words may need review and refinement. Earlier review session notes: One party depends on the existence of another party for their business survival. Networks of economic relationships. Why this matters: This impacts portfolio. Correlation. e.g. if I supply windscreens to 1 manufacturer what happens if that goes bust? Logically, contagion risk is about correlation.</skos:editorialNote>
