EDM Council FIBO Data Dictionary
    </h1>
<b>NOTE: The Data Dictionary underwent a complete overhaul from Q32017 to Q42017.  The product that was formerly called "Data Dictionary" is still available, as part of the <a href="../glossary/index.html">FIBO Glossary</a>.</b>

<p>For selected classes in FIBO, we generate a spreadsheet that describes the class as if it were a table in a relational database.  This includes definitions of all properties (fields) that are relevant to that class (table), as well as the allowable types for those fields.  English language defintions for the tables and fields are also included.  Each spreadsheet includes defintions for all referenced types, thereby providing a snapshot that includes everything FIBO knows about the target class.   </p>

<p>The data dictionary is available only for the Production release of FIBO.
