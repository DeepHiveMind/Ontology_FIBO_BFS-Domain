bubu<dct:abstract rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">This ontology describes loan and mortgage loan products. A product as defined here is something marketed and offered for sale, in this case a loan, such that when a customer takes on the product, they become signatories to a corresponding loan contract. A loan product in this sense is a contractual , off-the-shelf product with terms corresponding to those in the actual contract when it is signed.
		Note that considerable work has been done on products to support a separate loan product concept in the HMDA-derived Loan Contracts module, so this work now needs integrating with that or deprecating</dct:abstract>

bubu<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&rdf;langString" xml:lang="en">This is defined in terms of a &quot;Product&quot;, that is it is not itself the loan but is the pre-packaging of a possible loan product that might be made available by a given lender. See &quot;Loan&quot; for the actual loan which comes into effect at the point at which it is drawn down (draw down date). This term Loan Product defines only the packaging of possible loans as products made available by a lender (similar to insurance products made available by a retail insurance company, which are not the same as the policy or the underwriting of a specific instance of that policy). Note that the draft definition here replaces one that was a carbon copy of the &quot;Loan&quot; definition. Loan Product is not for a specific amount i.e. the amount is agreed as part of negotiating a specific Loan Contract between lender and borrower, based on the terms contained in this Loan Product definition.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
