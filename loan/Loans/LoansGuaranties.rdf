bubu<skos:definition rdf:datatype="&rdf;langString" xml:lang="en">A guaranty which is given up to a given amount or proportion of the loan. Generally specified as a monetary amount and is specified by the lender, so the bank may say 75% of valuation and they only have 60% of valuation available, to an additional limited guaranty would cover the missing 15% up to the point where the primary borrower&apos;s equity would meet the standard conditions of the loan. At that point the limited guaranty ceases.</skos:definition>
bubu<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&rdf;langString" xml:lang="en">For example in the case of a joint guaranty between school and lender, the school is offering a limited guaranty, i.e. it onlky covers the loan up to a proportion. See alsl (in Aus) family Loan has Family Guaranty. So borrower might provide limited guaranty up to a given amount, for instance primary borrower needs a 100K deposit, only has 50K so the co-borrower (guarantor) would guaranty the deposito but not the whole house. time limit - would come to an end at some point, defined in the contract. This would possibly be defined in the contract terms, not as a defined time but you would contact the bank and ask to be exempted from the stated conditions at such a time as the primary has now met the status to be a borrower i their own right.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

bubu<skos:definition rdf:datatype="&rdf;langString" xml:lang="en">Mortgage Indemnity Guaranty (MIG) provider. Further notes: SME Review notes 16 Sept: Guaranty - mortgage insurance e.g. insure up to 80% exposure. When you get into indemnification, then for instance if the product doesn&apos;t meet the investor&apos;s requirement such that if it doesn&apos;t get paid then the lender steps in and takes the hit for the loan - this is usually a precondition for securitizing (issuing) the loan in a pool. If the loan is not going to be sold on the secondary market there would be no need to indemnify that loan so this term would not apply. Indemnification is insurance for the investor, while the lender is the one providing that indemnification.</skos:definition>

bubu<skos:editorialNote rdf:datatype="&rdf;langString" xml:lang="en">See notes from SME Review and in MIG Provider. Applies to securitized pool, insures the lender. Additional note (IBM): there is a further application of this. When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new &quot;Party&quot; type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about &quot;the&quot; contract? The notes about 80% above (IBM) are about the individual loan. ACTION: Tidy this up.</skos:editorialNote>
