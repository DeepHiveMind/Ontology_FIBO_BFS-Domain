    <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Added to enhance Proof of Concept model, which has an aggregation relation from Loan Status to Loan Proceeding. That would not be literally correct as it would make a proceeding (and activity) part of a status. Rather, it must be the status of that proceeding, which is part of this status information set and is reported on at the point in time that the other loan status information may be reported on. Action: Although this "is of" a defined kind of activity called Loan Proceeding, that does not satisfy the need for a dated set of statuses. Need a selection list, based on facts about the Loan Default Proceedings, e.g. Imminent, Pending, Ongoing, Closed. Mabe some of those should be part of a wider list of common terms about all legal proceedings statuses.</skos:editorialNote>
