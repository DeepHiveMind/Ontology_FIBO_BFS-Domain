      <skos:editorialNote>This is a US-specific type of entity defined in new and emerging legislation in the US states of California, Hawaii, Virginia, Maryland, Vermont, New Jersey. Additional upcoming legislation (as at November 2011) in Colorado, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan. Much of the description is framed in terms of the role of the entity rather than its nature, however the legislation specifically relaxes or otherwise changes the basic parameters of the Incorporated Company structure (for example relaxing the requirement to maximize shareholder return) It may therefore be more correct to define this as a type of Incorporated Company not a role that one sits in. Having said this, B Corporations are certified by a certifying body (B Lab), which impies that they already exist and are granted a status in a similar way to that granted to non profit enterprises. Therefore at present this is defined as a status which an Incorporated Company may attain. Web reference: www.bcorporation.net</skos:editorialNote>
