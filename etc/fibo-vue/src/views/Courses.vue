Businesses today need to have comprehensive control and understanding of the data both within the enterprise and from outside. Regulatory pressure in many industries requires that an enterprise be able to find all relevant data about customers, products, business relations and in fact any aspect of the business quickly and accurately. Advances in data analytics have shown that the more meaningful data an enterprise can bring to bear, the more accurately business drivers can be predicted. For this reason, many businesses are migrating from viewing their enterprise information as a collection of data to viewing it as an ongoing graph of meaningful knowledge.

<h1><span>Course Pallete</span></h1>
<p><em>Open Knowledge graph and FIBO Fundamentals Course</em> is just part of our educational offer. Our full offer of courses covers different areas of Knowledge Graph Industry. These are shown below as a mind map that interlinks different learning topics.</p>

<img style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/img/course_palette_legend.png" alt="FIBO Course Map Legend" />
<p>The map is split into six course modules, which are then split into smaller training blocks. Obviously, the modules and the blocks are not independent from one another as some require knowledge provided by others. Therefore the map shows which modules and blocks depend on which, i.e., it shows what you need to master before you can dig into something else.</p>
