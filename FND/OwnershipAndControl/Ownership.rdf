		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level, ownership-related concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include the concept of owner, asset and ownership along with relationships between them whereby an asset is some thing owned by some owner.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20180801/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to revise the definition of Asset using the new CombinedDateTime datatype rather than xsd:dateTime to provide increased flexibility.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20190401/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to add definitions for tangible and intangible asset, etc., as needed for refinement of the concept of collateral and other loan-specific concepts.</skos:changeNote>
