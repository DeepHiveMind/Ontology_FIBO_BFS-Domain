		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">AddressSites</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>Defines the concepts of different kinds of address delineated according to their function, for example delivery address, headquarters address. 
		The published Release ontologies use a simpler pattern in which the role or nature of the address is conveyed in the relationships only. This conceptual ontology is provided for those uses where things need to be said about these kinds of address, for example in regulations about reporing or company registration.</dct:abstract>
