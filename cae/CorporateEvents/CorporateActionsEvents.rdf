Such choices would include: - Currency - Pay in Kind ("Spinoff" or PiK - see PiK corporate Action) Could be mandatory. If there were an option then the letter announcing it would require a response. This is usually stated in the message. Is there a message even if there is no option? Yes.

Q: That is the point at there was a choice you would expect to see a message, or end up still having to generate it but with the choices. A: The ones with Choices come as announcements and don't ave to be generated by the Service. Older definitin (re-scoped now: An Event in which a payment occurs. Anything can have a payment event.

    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">There are different taxation rules for the Bonus Issue compared to the Dividend. There could also be a difference in the ranking of the shares that are given, to what the holder already holds. Always announce the event on the ones that they hold, and based on the holding they are given additional shares. They may be of a different ranking. Bonus Issues increase the capital base but not the capital value of the company, since all they are doing is diluting the share capital. Difference from Dividend: Increases holding of shareholder. Other similar terms: Awards; Also see difference between Dividend and Bonus. Dividend is from current profits and bonus may be from accumulated reserves of the company. Separate this into 2 terms. We have: Capitalisation Issue Bonus rights Issue Original SWIFT definition - strippoed out synonyms for the formal definition above: "Attribution Gratuite (FR); Scrip Issue (GB); Capitalisation Issue. Security holders are awarded additional assets free of payment from the issuer in priportion to their holding." More 25 May A scrip issue is the issue of new shares at no charge pro rata to the holder of existing shares. This means the term Scrip Issue is as modeled here "no charge". But Capitalization becomes close to this in definition. More detail May 25: No change to the par value of the share so why would there be a change inthe capitaliation? Because from an accountingf point of view they change the value of overall capital of the company - they don't change the market value of the conpany but the accountants will record an increase in the issued capital of the company. This is the disctinction between nominal capital and the market capital. Nominal - there is more nominal share value.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Sometimes this is offered at market prices, so all you are doing is offering shareholders the right to purchase. Conclusion: Not "in proportion" at all. REVISE: May also have Bonus Rights Issue, where you don' have a subscriptiojn price. This works like a rights issue but without a price attached to it. The rate of how many you can buy is definitely in proportion to your holding. The rate of distribution of the right is proportional to the holdings. Another difference: A Rights thing you have to pay for the additional shares if you choose to purchase them (exercise the right) whereas a Bonus Issue you do not pay, you get them outright for free. TWO PARTS: 1. Distribution of the rights in proportion to their holding 2. Exercise of the Rights. Hence RHDI v EXRI where EXRI is the exercising of the right to purchase the shares. The Rights that are distributed is a formal "Rights" instrument.

REVIEW AND CLEAN OUT: Broader definition would also include things which might change the market price (for debt or equity), there asre things fo which you have to notify the market. these do not necessarily include changes to the details of the security. Most CAE will change the market perception. Not all actions which change the market perception are Corporate Events. Suggestion A corporate action is a generic class not actually homogenous, one of whcih si the Corporate Action of providin information to the market. There are legal requirements in most jurisdicitons saying that companies must advise their shareholders or bondhoders, about things whic might change the price. A separate kind of event notifies holders of securities (shares or bonds) of events which require an aciton on the part of the older (mandatory or bvoluntart) of the holder of the share. Then there are a set of events that don't get classified as CAE but have been included by SWIFT which are the actions by the holder, which would impact the issuer. These include calls on rights.

SWIFT Definition (adapted above) "Typically found in Australia, shares are issued from the Share Premium Reserve of the company and are considered as a capital distribution rather than a disbursement of income, with different tax implications." To be researches further. There are certainly Share Plans in Australia, where you can take a dividend as shares. Thewse would be in the nature of Bonus Shares. They are a tradeoff from cash dividends. Other terms to model: A "Scheme of Arrangment" - does this change the capital reserves or is it just another word for restructure. An arrangement with the company's debtors, and coule potentially change the capital base by converting the debt to shares (see other diagram note with these in).</skos:definition>

    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The party to which the offer is made need not be the holder. Details: Question on "Who is the actor?" Dutch auction would have multiple parties? What is the scenario? Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors. So in this scenario everyone has to be given the opportunity to sell at the given price. so the CAE message is still issued by the Issuer. SWIFT detailed names (synonym?) "Dutch Auction, Bid Tender"</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. UPDATE THIS DEFINITION: Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is the result of an action by a third party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don't interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ "Issuers Agent". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public.</skos:definition>

However, we question this - if you have the chance to purchase shares at a particular price (which is a right) would extend the definition of .. 20 July: this could have a broader meaning than Capital reserves Distribution It would include distribution of capital and trying to raise capital by additional capital injection Example: If the company issues bonds, that also changes the capital base. Now to change the capital base, there are two directions, up or down. Bonus issue falls into the above because you are increasing the capital base. A rights issue also increateses the capital base. Distributions of capital has the opposite effect. Paying out cash to reduce those items that are in your reserves. the reserves are greater than you need so you pay out cash on those.

    <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">For example an offer made in the context of a takeover bid. Quesytion: if a third party makes such an action, doe sthe issuer also have to send out the notification? If the company is listed ,then the issuer is also obligated to notify holders that this thing is taking place. If both companies are listed, both have to send out a notificaiton to the market that they are doing this action. So the target company has to notify the market. sothere is a separate message which is the target company notifying its holders that a Tender Offer etc. is taking place. Is this in the ISO 15022 list? Are they both done with the same message? Example: Company B makes a bid in private to Company A. Discussion may go on in private. At some point you have to legally make it clear. So then Company A says "we are being approached by company B" and Company B has to put out a message saying "We are going to try and take over Company B". Are they the same message? The "Tender Offer" message type is rich enough that both things can be conveyed. So when we try to semantically distinguish the message from the action? The party making the bid completes different fields in the message, to those filled in by the target company. This then marks out the semantics of "This is a bid offer and I am the 3rd party" or "I am reporting a bid offer". Semantically: There is an event and there is a message describing the event. TElling the market about something happening to a company can be something your company is doing, or something causing a change in circumstances. Either way, the issuer of the affected securities has to identify and notify that there is something which might be affecting the price of their securities. May be internal or external things, and either way the issuer has to notify the market.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The amount of additional rights that may be purchased by the holder over and above the initial allocation. Further notes: In addition to a Subscription Price (see the Price term in the Subscription rights term), there is an additional privilege extended to the holders, to subscribe to additional shares. This also is in a certain proportion. This is to catch if not enough rights were subscribed, you may be left with some left over. These can then be given to the over-subscribers. Additional terms: if this exists there is a ratio for this as well. Notes Some people may pass up the right, and another person may pick this up through over-subscription. Therefore there is no oversubscription on a Bonus issue because people are getting it for free.</skos:definition>
